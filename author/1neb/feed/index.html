				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of November 1st, 2012, <a href="http://bloom.io">Bloom Studio Inc</a>. has ceased operations.  We’d like to thank all of you who accompanied us in our explorations of new forms of playful data-driven discovery. <a href="http://planetary.bloom.io">Planetary</a> was downloaded onto over 2 million iPads and was hailed by users and critics alike as one of the most beautiful experiences to push graphic performance on their new devices.</p>
<p>We have been working with the ideas behind applications like Planetary and <a href="http://biologic.bloom.io">Biologic</a> since long before we came together to form Bloom, and we will doubtlessly reapproach this space again in future manifestations of our work.  Seed-funded ventures are like essays striving for the culture-changing insight.  Who knows what our next iterations will bring?  I think we might have some ideas&#8230;   Follow the founders at <a href="http://twitter.com/neb">@neb</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/randometc">@randometc</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/jandersen">@jandersen</a>.</p>
<h3>Practically Speaking</h3>
<p>Sadly but predictably we need to turn off the servers that power our Biologic app, and its web-based sibling <a href="http://fizz.bloom.io">Fizz</a>, so those apps will cease along with Bloom itself in the next few days. We don’t store much in the way of personal data but anything we do have will be deleted and the app permissions will be revoked.</p>
<p>We will keep Planetary available in the App Store for as long as we possibly can, and as individuals (with some help from our friends) we’ll be seeking a safe way to preserve it for future devices and platforms. Watch this space!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Playful visual discovery application platform secures seed round funding from Betaworks, SV Angel, and Individual Investors</em></p>
<p>San Francisco, CA.  April 11, 2011</p>
<p>Bloom Studio Inc. today announced the closing of a seed round of funding led by <a href="http://betaworks.com/">Betaworks</a> with participation from <a href="http://www.svangel.com/">SV Angel</a>. Additional investors include Stewart Butterfield, co-founder of Flickr. The terms of the financing were not disclosed.</p>
<p>“Betaworks is more than just an investor” said Ben Cerveny, founder and president, Bloom Studio. “Their insights into the landscape at the intersection of culture and technology help us focus on the big opportunities.”</p>
<p>Bloom is rolling out a series of engaging and playful applications on iOS and web platforms that make social media and streaming media datasets easier to explore and understand. Their first applications will be available in the iOS app store later this quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very excited about the vision of Bloom.&#8221; said John Borthwick, CEO of betaworks, &#8220;At betaworks we have built some very large real time data sets, including bitly, chartbeat and socialflow. Bloom&#8217;s vision of turning real time social data into dynamic visual objects is a vital part of the future. These objects will let users understand, navigate, play and use datasets in whole new ways&#8221;</p>
<p>Bloom has already begun to demonstrate the kind of fluid playful discovery it&#8217;s applications will bring to everyday online activities like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. These preview experiences can be found on <a title="Bloom: Pop-cultural instruments for data expression and exploration." href="http://bloom.io">http://bloom.io</a> or directly at <a title="Fizz - Visualize your Twitter and Facebook networks" href="http://fizz.bloom.io">http://fizz.bloom.io</a> and <a title="Cartagram - Instagram photos on a map" href="http://cartagr.am">http://cartagr.am</a>. Forthcoming &#8220;instruments&#8221;, as the small, playful applications are called, will focus on discovery within streaming audio and video services.</p>
<h2>About Bloom Studio:</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Bloom!  Our mission to bring you a new type of visual discovery experience is already underway. We&#8217;re building a series of bite-sized applications that bring the richness of game interactions and the design values of motion graphics to the depth and breadth of social network activity, locative tools, and streaming media services.  These new &#8216;visual instruments&#8217; will help you explore your digital life more fluidly and see patterns and rhythms in the online services you care about. And they&#8217;re coming to a tablet, media console, or modern web browser near you!</p>
<div id="attachment_116" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://fizz.bloom.io"><img class="size-medium wp-image-116 " title="Fizz on bloom.io" src="http://bloomio.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/fizz-screenshot.png?w=300&#038;h=185" alt="" width="300" height="185" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fizz on bloom.io</p></div>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to invite you in to our newly redesigned site at <a title="Bloom" href="http://bloom.io">bloom.io</a>, where we&#8217;ll be showcasing the first instances of the experiences we&#8217;re designing, starting with <a title="Fizz by Bloom" href="http://bloom.io/fizz/" target="_blank">Fizz</a> and <a title="Cartagr.am by Bloom" href="http://cartagr.am" target="_blank">Cartagram</a>.  What is important to realize about these, as with all of our coming applications, is that they are the foundations of a constant flow of ongoing iterative development, much like video game franchises.  As a participant in the Bloom Network, you&#8217;ll be presented with an ever-changing, ever-increasing variety of views onto the world&#8217;s most popular web services like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, youTube, Netflix, Dropbox, Instagram, and so forth.  Some of these instruments will be lyrical, some playful, some analytic, many of them combinations of all three, but all will provide compelling and engaging handles on the information that matters to you most, each one evolving and improving over time, building on your understanding of its performance. Starting later this year, you&#8217;ll find these instruments on iOS and Android devices, like tablets, phones, and media consoles in the home.</p>
<p>In order to make these experiences possible, many of which will use the latest in 3D graphics, simulation, and data modeling frameworks, we&#8217;ve brought together quite a team.  I&#8217;m particularly excited to announce that we&#8217;ve most recently been joined by our new Creative Director, Robert Hodgin.  For those not familiar with his work, please take a moment to browse his portfolio at <a title="Robert Hodgin" href="http://roberthodgin.com" target="_blank">roberthodgin.com</a> or his blog at <a title="Flight 404 by Robert Hodgin" href="http://flight404.com" target="_blank">flight404.com</a>, and you&#8217;ll quickly see why we&#8217;re so enthused to welcome him to the team.</p>
<div id="attachment_120" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://vimeo.com/7578615"><img class="size-medium wp-image-120" title="Solar Rework by Robert Hodgin" src="http://bloomio.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/solarrework.png?w=300&#038;h=168" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">still from Solar Rework by Robert Hodgin</p></div>
<p>His dynamic visuals have backed musicians performing on tour like Peter Gabriel and Aphex Twin, and he designed the popular Magnetosphere music visualizer in Apple&#8217;s iTunes.  He is the foremost implementer of <a title="Cinder" href="http://libcinder.org" target="_blank">Cinder</a>, a C++ graphics framework that underlies much of our work, and is engaged in constant investigations of emergent complexity in generative design, much like the rest of us here at Bloom.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re very excited about what lies ahead in the coming years.  The ways in which people interact with computation are changing swiftly as we move into more casual relationships with our digital services on tablets, big screens, and across social networks.  We believe we have some compelling answers about how digital experiences will evolve into these new contexts.  Please, follow along with us and explore these playful, dynamic instruments of discovery together.</p>
