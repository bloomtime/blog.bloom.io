				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Bloom!  Our mission to bring you a new type of visual discovery experience is already underway. We&#8217;re building a series of bite-sized applications that bring the richness of game interactions and the design values of motion graphics to the depth and breadth of social network activity, locative tools, and streaming media services.  These new &#8216;visual instruments&#8217; will help you explore your digital life more fluidly and see patterns and rhythms in the online services you care about. And they&#8217;re coming to a tablet, media console, or modern web browser near you!</p>
<div id="attachment_116" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://fizz.bloom.io"><img class="size-medium wp-image-116 " title="Fizz on bloom.io" src="/files/2011/02/fizz-screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" height="185" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fizz on bloom.io</p></div>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to invite you in to our newly redesigned site at <a title="Bloom" href="http://bloom.io">bloom.io</a>, where we&#8217;ll be showcasing the first instances of the experiences we&#8217;re designing, starting with <a title="Fizz by Bloom" href="http://bloom.io/fizz/" target="_blank">Fizz</a> and <a title="Cartagr.am by Bloom" href="http://cartagr.am" target="_blank">Cartagram</a>.  What is important to realize about these, as with all of our coming applications, is that they are the foundations of a constant flow of ongoing iterative development, much like video game franchises.  As a participant in the Bloom Network, you&#8217;ll be presented with an ever-changing, ever-increasing variety of views onto the world&#8217;s most popular web services like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, youTube, Netflix, Dropbox, Instagram, and so forth.  Some of these instruments will be lyrical, some playful, some analytic, many of them combinations of all three, but all will provide compelling and engaging handles on the information that matters to you most, each one evolving and improving over time, building on your understanding of its performance. Starting later this year, you&#8217;ll find these instruments on iOS and Android devices, like tablets, phones, and media consoles in the home.</p>
<p>In order to make these experiences possible, many of which will use the latest in 3D graphics, simulation, and data modeling frameworks, we&#8217;ve brought together quite a team.  I&#8217;m particularly excited to announce that we&#8217;ve most recently been joined by our new Creative Director, Robert Hodgin.  For those not familiar with his work, please take a moment to browse his portfolio at <a title="Robert Hodgin" href="http://roberthodgin.com" target="_blank">roberthodgin.com</a> or his blog at <a title="Flight 404 by Robert Hodgin" href="http://flight404.com" target="_blank">flight404.com</a>, and you&#8217;ll quickly see why we&#8217;re so enthused to welcome him to the team.</p>
<div id="attachment_120" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://vimeo.com/7578615"><img class="size-medium wp-image-120" title="Solar Rework by Robert Hodgin" src="/files/2011/02/solarrework.png" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">still from Solar Rework by Robert Hodgin</p></div>
<p>His dynamic visuals have backed musicians performing on tour like Peter Gabriel and Aphex Twin, and he designed the popular Magnetosphere music visualizer in Apple&#8217;s iTunes.  He is the foremost implementer of <a title="Cinder" href="http://libcinder.org" target="_blank">Cinder</a>, a C++ graphics framework that underlies much of our work, and is engaged in constant investigations of emergent complexity in generative design, much like the rest of us here at Bloom.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re very excited about what lies ahead in the coming years.  The ways in which people interact with computation are changing swiftly as we move into more casual relationships with our digital services on tablets, big screens, and across social networks.  We believe we have some compelling answers about how digital experiences will evolve into these new contexts.  Please, follow along with us and explore these playful, dynamic instruments of discovery together.</p>
