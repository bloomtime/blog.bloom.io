		<description><![CDATA[Hey Rados - try doing a full sync with iTunes, or try restarting your iPad. We&#039;ve also heard that Planetary won&#039;t work on jailbroken iPads, sorry if that affects you. Failing that please email us planetary@bloom.io and we&#039;ll get back to you as soon as we can. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi guys,

Awesome stuff you&#039;re doing - very excited to see how you go in the whole field of web data visualization and navigation, not just music.

Any thoughts of an IPO?  I&#039;m in! ;-)

Best,

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just started playing with the app and it look great and has me very excited.

I immediately wonder though if there are plans to tie Planetary into more sophisticated networks for analyzing and exploring music?  Alphabetical constellations seem so terribly limited. I would love to see constellations based upon the links between various groups and musicians, something more akin to last.fm but visual.

For example, in my library Planetary made a link between Alec Empire and Alec Empire vs Merzbow, but there is no direct link between Alec Empire and his band Atari Teenage Riot.

The old music network maps and visualizations seem like a fantastic direction to take Planetary helping users to find connections they may not have realized within their own music libraries and pointing them toward new starts and constellations outside their direct library.]]></description>
