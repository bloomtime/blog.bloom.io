		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jonny,

It&#039;s technically possible, yes, if you make a playlist featuring every artist. We avoided making this view available by default because it can get slow and unstable (due to memory restrictions) if you have a lot of artists. But give it a try, it should work fine for a few hundred artists. Plus, if you set the playlist going on shuffle and zoom in to album or track level, you get your own full galaxy tour, which is my favorite part of the app. Good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, is it possible to view all artists rather than by individual letter?

Thanks,

Yes, I am a little bit sad about this. It was a beautiful starting point. Like if you look through a telescope up to the sky.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jennifer,

Sadly the alphabet-wheel has gone into retirement. We were sad to see it go but found it a difficult metaphor to extend to other navigation and filtering features like playlists. Hopefully the addition of playlists is a worthwhile improvement, and you can see that it paves the way for other ways of browsing in future (e.g. genre). 

The alphabet artist filter is now accessed with the ABC button in the main control panel. Same functionality as the wheel, slightly different interaction, and not quite as distinctive. I do hope you don&#039;t miss the wheel too much!

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a beautiful, great app. I loved the version 1 and today I updated to version 2. There are great new features, I appreciate it.
Now could you explain to me, how can I get back to the alphabet-wheel, I don&#039;t find it anymore.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No news yet, sorry. The tablet really is a different medium and it&#039;s the one we&#039;re most excited to explore at the moment. We&#039;re still growing our team though, so perhaps we&#039;ll get a chance to look at the iphone/ipod soon. Unfortunately they&#039;re not just small iPads so it requires a bit more thought than just moving things around. Fingers crossed!]]></description>
